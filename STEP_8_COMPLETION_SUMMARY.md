### 🔧 Key Features Implemented

#### Validation Capabilities
- **Multi-level severity**: INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- **Data type validation**: Market (OHLCV), Sentiment (scores/confidence), Economic (indicators)
- **Business logic checks**: Price relationships, volume constraints, score ranges
- **Statistical analysis**: IQR-based outlier detection, missing data patterns
- **Time series validation**: Index sorting, temporal gaps, frequency analysis
- **Cross-dataset consistency**: Unified dataset validation

#### Quality Metrics
- **Quality score calculation**: 100-point scale with weighted deductions
- **Pass/fail determination**: Based on critical issues and configurable thresholds
- **Issue categorization**: Structure, index, columns, data types, ranges, missing data, duplicates, outliers, business logic
- **Performance tracking**: Operation timing, memory usage, throughput metrics

#### Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: Continue processing with warnings for non-critical issues
- **Structured error reporting**: Detailed issue descriptions with context
- **Alert mechanisms**: Configurable thresholds for automated notifications
