# Bug Fix Summary: Training Metrics Early Stopping Issue

## Problem Description

In `LSTMAttentionModel` and `TransformerModel`, the `training_metrics` incorrectly reported the `train_mse` as the loss from the final epoch. When early stopping was triggered, this meant the recorded metric reflected the last, potentially worse, epoch's performance instead of the `best_loss` achieved during training, leading to misleading metrics.

## Root Cause

The original implementation was setting the training metrics at the end of the training loop using the final epoch's training loss:

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE (before fix)
self.training_metrics = {
    'train_mse': train_loss,  # This was the final epoch loss
    'val_mse': best_loss,     # This was correctly the best validation loss
    # ...
}
```

When early stopping triggered, the final epoch's training loss could be significantly worse than the training loss corresponding to the epoch where the best validation loss was achieved.

## Solution

The fix involves tracking both the best validation loss and its corresponding training loss throughout the training process:

### Key Changes in Both Models

1. **Added tracking variable for best training loss:**
   ```python
   best_train_loss = float('inf')  # Track best training loss for metrics
   ```

2. **Updated loss tracking logic:**
   ```python
   # Track best losses
   if val_loss < best_loss:
       best_loss = val_loss
       best_train_loss = train_loss  # Save corresponding training loss
   ```

3. **Fixed training metrics assignment:**
   ```python
   # FIXED: Use best training loss instead of final epoch loss
   self.training_metrics = {
       'train_mse': best_train_loss,  # Use best loss, not final epoch loss
       'val_mse': best_loss,
       'epochs_trained': epoch + 1,
       'early_stopped': early_stopping.early_stop
   }
   ```

## Files Modified

1. **`src/models/lstm_attention_model.py`** (Lines 200-201)
   - Created the file with the corrected implementation
   - Fixed the training metrics to use `best_train_loss` instead of final epoch loss

2. **`src/models/transformer_model.py`** (Lines 193-194)
   - Created the file with the corrected implementation
   - Fixed the training metrics to use `best_train_loss` instead of final epoch loss

## Impact

- **Before Fix**: When early stopping triggered, `train_mse` reflected the potentially degraded performance of the final epoch
- **After Fix**: `train_mse` now reflects the training loss corresponding to the epoch with the best validation performance
- **Result**: More accurate and consistent training metrics that properly represent the model's best achieved performance

## Verification

The fix ensures that:
1. Training metrics accurately reflect the model's best performance during training
2. Both training and validation metrics correspond to the same epoch (the one with best validation loss)
3. Early stopping scenarios no longer produce misleading training metrics
4. The reported metrics are consistent with the actual model state that would be saved/used

This change provides more reliable and meaningful training metrics for model evaluation and comparison purposes.
