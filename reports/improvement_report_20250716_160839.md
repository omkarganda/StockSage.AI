## Next Steps

### If Success Criteria Are Met (sMAPE < 50%, Direction ≥ 55%, Correlation ≥ 0.3):
1. **Deploy to Production**: Models are ready for live trading evaluation
2. **Implement Ensembling**: Combine top-performing models
3. **Add Advanced Features**: Implement macro/sentiment features

### If Success Criteria Are Not Yet Met:
1. **Further Hyperparameter Tuning**: Run extended Optuna optimization
2. **Feature Engineering**: Add PCA, sentiment data, option-implied volatility
3. **Data Quality Review**: Check for data leakage or target definition issues
4. **Alternative Architectures**: Consider ensemble methods or regime-switching models

### Monitoring
- Set up continuous validation pipeline
- Monitor for model drift
- Track alignment metrics over time
