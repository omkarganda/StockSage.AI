## Project Blueprint: Stock Price Prediction with Generative AI Insights

### Objective:
Build a robust AI-driven system that predicts stock prices by integrating generative AI techniques, market sentiment, and real-time economic indicators.

### Project Workflow:

### 1. Data Acquisition
- **Market Data:** Use `yfinance` to collect historical and real-time stock prices.
- **Economic Indicators:** Retrieve relevant economic indicators (interest rates, GDP growth, inflation rates, etc.) from reputable economic databases or APIs.
- **Sentiment Data:** Extract news articles, tweets, and financial reports through FinBERT or specialized financial models from Hugging Face.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Use `Pandas` and `Polars` for data cleaning, handling missing values, and data alignment (Polars for large datasets with 10x performance improvement).
- Feature engineering to create meaningful financial indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI).
- Tokenize and preprocess textual sentiment data using FinBERT for financial-specific sentiment analysis.
- Use `Plotly` for exploratory data analysis and initial data visualization.

### 3. Sentiment Analysis & Insights Extraction
- Apply FinBERT and specialized financial models for sentiment classification of news and social media data.
- Leverage `LangChain` or `LlamaIndex` to generate summaries and insights from textual data.
- Aggregate sentiment scores to align with financial time-series data.

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- **Traditional Forecasting:** Use `NeuralForecast` and `Sktime` for baseline forecasts with better deep learning integration and modern time series methods.
- **Generative AI Modeling:** Develop deep learning models using `PyTorch Lightning` for predicting stock prices, enhanced by sentiment insights and economic indicators.
- Integrate generative models via `OpenAI API` for scenario forecasting, sentiment-driven market predictions, and explainability.
- Use `Weights & Biases` for experiment tracking, hyperparameter tuning, and model versioning.

### 5. Model Evaluation & Validation
- Employ `Plotly` for interactive visualization and exploratory analysis of model predictions.
- Leverage `LangChain` or `LlamaIndex` for model explainability and generating human-readable insights about prediction reasoning.
- Perform rigorous backtesting to assess predictive performance historically.
- Use continuous validation to fine-tune models in real-time, ensuring adaptability to market shifts.

### 6. Deployment & User Interface
- Deploy models using `FastAPI` for production-ready REST API endpoints with automatic documentation.
- Develop an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Dash integrated with Plotly for intuitive visualization of predictions and sentiment insights.
- Implement cloud infrastructure for scalability and real-time inference.

### Tools & Technologies Recap:
- **Data Collection:** `yfinance`, APIs, FinBERT, Hugging Face
- **Data Handling:** `Pandas`, `Polars`
- **Textual Analysis:** FinBERT, `LangChain`, `LlamaIndex`
- **Forecasting:** `NeuralForecast`, `Sktime`
- **Deep Learning Framework:** `PyTorch Lightning`
