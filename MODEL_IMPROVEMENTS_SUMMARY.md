# StockSage.AI Model Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the critical improvements made to fix the model evaluation and training issues identified in the health check analysis. All changes address the fundamental problems that were causing unreliable performance metrics and poor model performance.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. MAPE Metric Problems âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) was causing extreme values (100-45,000%) due to division by values near zero, especially with return-based targets.

**Solution**: Replaced MAPE with SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error) throughout the codebase.

**Files Modified**:
- `scripts/evaluate_models.py` - Main evaluation logic
- `src/models/sktime_model.py` - Statistical model evaluations
- `src/models/neuralforecast_model.py` - Neural forecast evaluations
- `src/models/baseline.py` - Baseline model evaluations
- `scripts/train_models.py` - Training script outputs
- `tests/test_models.py` - Unit tests
- `tests/test_api.py` - API tests
- `src/app/dashboard.py` - Dashboard displays
- `src/app/api.py` - API responses

**Technical Details**:
```python
# OLD (problematic):
mape = np.mean(np.abs((actual - pred_values) / (np.abs(actual) + 1e-8))) * 100

# NEW (robust):
smape = np.mean(2 * np.abs(actual - pred_values) / (np.abs(actual) + np.abs(pred_values) + 1e-8)) * 100
```

### 2. Deep Learning Training Issues âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: LSTM and Transformer models were training for only 10 epochs, which is insufficient for convergence.

**Solution**: 
- Increased default epochs from 10 to 50
- Added early stopping with patience=10 to prevent overfitting
- Improved training efficiency by stopping when loss plateaus

**Files Modified**:
- `src/models/lstm_attention_model.py`
- `src/models/transformer_model.py`

**Technical Details**:
```python
# Added early stopping logic
best_loss = float('inf')
patience_counter = 0
patience = 10

for epoch in range(1, self.epochs + 1):
    # ... training loop ...
    if current_loss < best_loss:
        best_loss = current_loss
        patience_counter = 0
    else:
        patience_counter += 1
        if patience_counter >= patience:
            logger.info(f"Early stopping at epoch {epoch}")
            break
```

### 3. Statistical Model Log Transform Issues âœ… FIXED
**Problem**: ETS, Theta, and Ensemble models were using log transformation by default, which was causing poor performance with price level data.

**Solution**: Automatically disable log transform for ETS, Theta, and Ensemble models while keeping it for other models that benefit from it.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/models/sktime_model.py`

**Technical Details**:
```python
# Conditional log transform based on model type
if model_type in ['ets', 'theta', 'ensemble']:
    self.use_log_transform = False
    logger.info(f"Disabled log transform for {model_type} model as recommended")
else:
    self.use_log_transform = use_log_transform
```

## Impact Assessment

### Before Improvements:
- MAPE values: 100% to 45,000% (meaningless)
- LSTM/Transformer: Poor performance due to insufficient training
- Statistical models: Inconsistent results due to inappropriate log transforms
- Evaluation metrics: Contradictory signals (good MAPE vs poor directional accuracy)

### After Improvements:
- SMAPE values: Expected to be in realistic range (5-20% for financial returns)
- Deep Learning: Better convergence with 50 epochs + early stopping
- Statistical models: Proper handling of price level data for ETS/Theta/Ensemble
- Evaluation metrics: Consistent and interpretable results

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Completed**:
1. MAPE â†’ SMAPE conversion across all components
2. Deep learning training improvements (epochs + early stopping)
3. Statistical model log transform fixes
4. Test suite updates
5. Dashboard and API updates

ðŸ”„ **Ready for Testing**:
- Re-run model evaluation with: `python scripts/evaluate_models.py AAPL`
- Expected improvements in metric consistency and model performance

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Run the improved evaluation on AAPL to validate fixes
2. **Short-term**: Apply to other symbols and validate cross-stock performance
3. **Medium-term**: Implement additional recommendations:
   - Feature engineering improvements
   - Rolling cross-validation
   - Meta-learning/ensembling

## Validation Criteria

The improvements are successful if:
- SMAPE values are in 5-20% range
- Directional accuracy > 55-60%
- Positive correlation â‰¥ 0.3 for at least one model
- Consistent metric rankings (no contradictions)
